# React-uploader
App to upload videos, using React.
Still want to:
-Configure RabbitMQ to enable large videos to be sent over the network
-Add validation for video formats
-Add verification and security
-Add unit tests
-Add DB calls to insert all information in the table
-Add video splitting module to cut each video into 4s frames
-Add buttons and functionality to add, delete, pause and continue file uploads within a group
-Add progress bar
